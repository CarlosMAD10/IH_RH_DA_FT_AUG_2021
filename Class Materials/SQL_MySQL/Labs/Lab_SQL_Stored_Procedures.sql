/*

Your manager now want to have these KPIs as SQL stored procedures, 
so that they can run them anytime from the server.
You should write procedures that output the following:

1.  A list of cities and their revenue, sorted by revenue, only showing cities that belong to states with a revenue above a certain threshold.
1.2 BONUS: The previous procedure only outputs the top 3 cities by each state.
2. Top N cities by Avg Order amount.
